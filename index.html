  			SIR Modeling 
  		</b>

  	<font size="4"> 
			<p>
				SIR stands for Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered. 
				These models are commonly used in disease control to estimate the rate of disease spread in a closed community.
				The graph allows researchers to estimate how many people have either not contracted the disease, currently are infectious, and are no longer infected.
			</p>
			<p>
				This graph was created using recursion functions.
				In each day, some people in the susceptible category are added into the infected category.
				The amount of people who become infected is dependent on the population of infected, susceptible, and infectiousness.
				The higher those three values are, the more contagious the disease will be, and the larger the amount of people who become infected.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also in each day, a certain fraction of the infected population recover from the disease.
				Those who are moved into the recovered category can no longer be infected, and are in a separate group from the susceptible.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each day, some amount of susceptible people are infected, and some infected become recovered.
				The rate of transfer between these categories depends on the changing populations of the categories.
				This cycle repeats until there are no more infected people to infected others. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Use the sliders below to change how infectious a disease is and how quickly a person recovers.
				The numbers in the boxes tell how many people are in the community and how many are initially infected, which can be changed.
				The slider on the right tells what percent of the population belongs to each of the three categories on a certain day within the first year.
				Note the patterns formed by the graphs as you move the sliders for infectivity and recovery.
